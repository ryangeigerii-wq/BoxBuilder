# Agent Activity Log & Validation Guide

This document records agent-driven modifications, rationale behind each change, and how to validate the current system state. It complements `README.md` by focusing on the automation workflow and traceability.

## 1. Objectives
- Maintain a lightweight, framework-free frontend for the box builder.
- Incrementally refine UI layout and usability (menus, alignment, visibility).
- Remove abandoned experiments (LemonadeJS, WASM) to reduce cognitive load.
- Preserve determinism in SVG rendering and clear state transitions.
- Provide transparent verification steps after each iterative change.

## 2. Completed Changes (Chronological Summary)
1. Removed LemonadeJS vendor script and associated loader logic from template.
2. Deleted Rust WASM experimental directory and references; reverted to pure JS.
3. Cleaned `box_builder.js`: eliminated duplicate SVG template chunks and stray inline CSS injection.
4. Fixed ghost panel logic: proper edge lines and hatch styling without duplication.
5. Resolved scoping issue for `ghostEdges` variable (moved declaration outside conditional block).
6. Repositioned Wall Thickness input above collapsible menus to emphasize its influence on internal volume.
7. Merged Port Type selection into the Port Design fieldset for cohesive port configuration UX.
8. Centered zoom bar above preview; replaced checkmark highlight with outline-only active state.
9. Moved Cut Diameter into a unified triple row with Subwoofer Size and (renamed) Sub Count.
10. Renamed visible label "Sub Layout" → "Sub Count" while keeping form `name="subConfig"` for backward compatibility.
11. Added CSS class `.triple-field` to standardize field sizing and alignment across multi-column rows.
12. Updated README with implementation summary and detailed validation checklist.
13. Added optional "Show Port Overlay" checkbox to port fieldset; gated local (pre-server) port visualization.

## 3. Files Added / Modified
- Modified: `app/templates/box_builder.html` (layout restructuring, label rename, zoom bar repositioning).
- Modified: `app/static/css/style.css` (added `.triple-field`).
- Modified: `README.md` (added sections: Recent Implementation Summary, Validation Checklist, Manual Command Reference).
- Unmodified core backend files retained for continuity.
- Added: `agents.md` (this file).

## 4. Removed Assets
- `app/static/js/vendor/lemonade.min.js`
- `app/wasm/` directory (Rust experiment)
- `app/core/lemonade_vendor.py`

## 5. Rationale Highlights
- Stack Simplification: Reduces maintenance overhead and onboarding friction.
- Deterministic Rendering: Avoids skewed or pseudo-3D transformations that complicate dimension interpretation.
- Grouping Related Inputs: Port Type consolidated with port parameters; cut diameter grouped with sub size & count.
- UX Clarity: Consistent field alignment reduces visual noise and scanning time.
- Backward Compatibility: Form field names unchanged; only labels altered for clarity.

## 6. Risk Mitigation
- Kept historical state logic intact (undo/redo unaffected by layout changes).
- Preserved query selectors relying on `name` attributes; only visual markup altered.
- Introduced minimal CSS additions rather than large refactors to avoid cascade regressions.

## 7. Validation Procedure (Quick Run)
```powershell
# Environment setup
python -m venv .venv
./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Browser checklist:
- Navigate to `/box-builder`; spinner disappears after JS init.
- Zoom bar centered above Preview (buttons Close / Normal / Wide).
- Wall Thickness located above Port Design & Cutout Settings buttons.
- Port Design menu includes Port Type field inside fieldset.
- Triple row shows: Cut Diameter (placeholder auto), Subwoofer Size, Sub Count.
- Changing dimensions updates SVG without console errors.
- Toggling ghost panels adds hatched semi-transparent panels and edge lines.
- Dual Sub Count adds a second hole; arrow key nudging works for selected hole.
- Leaving Cut Diameter blank applies 0.93× heuristic; entering override updates instantly.
- Undo/Redo functions (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) revert/apply last change.
- Show Port Overlay checkbox hides local estimated port shapes (server-computed ports still display if available).

## 8. Console / Network Assertions
- No network requests to removed Lemonade or WASM resources.
- `/static/js/box_builder.js` returns 200.
- Console free from `ReferenceError` or `TypeError` on load.

## 9. Test Execution
```powershell
pytest -q
# Optional Playwright smoke test
pytest tests/test_box_builder_playwright.py -q
```
Smoke test should: load builder, dismiss spinner, confirm dynamic preview updates.

## 10. Future Automation Suggestions
- Add CI step to diff SVG output for a set of canonical dimension inputs.
- Introduce ESLint configuration to catch future scoping mistakes early.
- Add accessibility scan (axe-core) via Playwright.
- Implement a simple snapshot test for triple-field alignment (DOM structure & CSS class presence).

## 11. Rollback Strategy
If UI regressions occur:
1. Revert template changes affecting layout (`box_builder.html`).
2. Remove `.triple-field` class usages; fall back to baseline `.triple` grid.
3. Re-run tests; ensure no JS exceptions tied to removed markup.

## 12. Open Items / Potential Enhancements
- SVG download implementation.
- Port visualization overlay (slot/round dimensions drawn in preview).
- Local storage persistence for last session state.
- Manufacturer spec integration & hole labeling.
- Unit conversion feature (in ↔ mm toggle).
- Discrepancy indicator when server tuning deviates > threshold from target/local estimate.

## 13. Glossary
- Heuristic Cut Diameter: `nominal_size * 0.93` fallback when explicit spec absent.
- Ghost Panels: Semi-transparent geometry providing spatial context for depth/back panels.
- Triple Row: Responsive grid grouping exactly three related inputs.

## 14. Contact / Maintenance Notes
Changes designed to minimize coupling: front-end logic restricted to a single JS file. Static asset cache busting ensures updates propagate without manual hard refresh.
