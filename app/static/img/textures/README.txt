Place licensed wood texture images here named:
- art.jpg
- brick.jpg
- flatwood.jpg
- stone.jpg

Guidelines:
1. Use moderate resolution (e.g. 512x512) to keep SVG pattern lightweight.
2. Prefer seamless or tileable textures; if not seamless, cropping may show edges.
3. Keep file sizes < 200KB for quick load.
4. Only include images you have rights to distribute; these are NOT committed if proprietary.

If an image is missing, faces fall back to gradient / flat colors.
