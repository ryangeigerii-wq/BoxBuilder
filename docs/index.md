# BoxBuilder Docs Index

Welcome to the documentation portal. Use the sections below to navigate.

## Sections

## Deployment Notes
This site is built from the `docs/` directory only. The application backend (FastAPI + builder UI) is served separately and isn’t executed here. For a static preview build, see `scripts/build_pages.py` in the repository.

## Source Reference
Primary README: repository root `README.md` (development guide). These docs focus on user & contributor guidance.
